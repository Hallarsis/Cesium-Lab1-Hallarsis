              **Dead Cells** is a roguelike metroidvania game that combines fast-paced combat with procedurally generated levels.
               You play as a sentient, ever-reviving mass of cells, exploring a sprawling, interconnected world filled with dangerous enemies, intricate traps, and hidden secrets.
               The game features a mix of intense, fluid combat and exploration, with a variety of weapons and abilities that can be customized to suit different playstyles.
               Each time you die, youâ€™re sent back to the beginning, but you retain certain upgrades and knowledge that help you progress further.
               The procedurally generated nature of the levels ensures that each run offers a unique experience, with ever-changing layouts and challenges.
               As you delve deeper, you'll uncover the mysteries of the island and its various biomes, facing increasingly formidable foes and uncovering new tools and abilities to aid in your quest for survival.
